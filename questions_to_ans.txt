When you added your .gitignore to your repo to ignore .csv files, was the file indeed ignored?

To check whether the .csv files are indeed ignored, we can run use the `git status` command.
If the .csv files are listed under "Untracked files," then they are being ignored because of the .gitignore file we added.

Why do we have to add `additional_dependencies` to mypy in the .pre-commit-config.yaml ?

When using mypy, additional_dependencies are required for several reasons:
    - Many libraries do not include type information by default. Without type hints, mypy has no information about what
      types are expected for the function parameters or what types the functions return.
    - In the .pre-commit-config.yaml, we specify which dependencies are required to ensure that mypy works correctly with
      our project. This ensures that anyone who clones the repo and uses the pre-commit hooks will have the proper dependencies
      installed automatically.
